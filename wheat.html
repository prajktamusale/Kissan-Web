            <span>Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain that is a worldwide staple
                food. The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most
                widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum). The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first
                cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a
                type of fruit called a caryopsis.

                In 2020, world production of wheat was 761 million tonnes (839 million short tons; 1.7 trillion pounds),
                making it the second most-produced cereal after maize. Since 1960, world production of wheat and
                other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century.[9]
                Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten
                proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing as a
                result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet.</span>

        <h1>ABOUT WHEAT</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. The total area under the crop is about 29.8 million hectares in the
            country. The production of wheat in the country has increased significantly from 75.81 million MT in 2006-07
            to an all time record high of 94.88 million MT in 2011-12. The productivity of wheat which was 2602
            kg/hectare in 2004-05 has increased to 3140 kg/hectare in 2011-12. The major increase in the productivity of
            wheat has been observed in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Higher area coverage is reported
            from MP in recent years.Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat,
            somewhat similar to U.S. hard white wheat. Wheat grown in central and western India is typically hard, with
            high protein and high gluten content. India also produces around 1.0-1.2 million tons of durum wheat, mostly
            in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Most Indian durum is not marketed separately due to segregation problems in
            the market yards. However, some quantities are purchased by the private trade at a price premium, mainly for
            processing of higher value/branded products.The production and productivity of Wheat crop were quite low,
            when India became independent in 1947. The production of Wheat was only 6.46 million tonnes and productivity
            was merely 663 kg per hectare during 1950-51, which was not sufficient to feed the Indian population. The
            Country used to import Wheat in large quantities for fulfilling the needs of our people from many countries
            like USA under PL-480. The reasons of low production and productivity of Wheat at that time was (a) the tall
            growing plant habit resulting in lodging, when grown under fertile soils, (b) the poor tillering and low
            sink capacity of the varieties used, (c) higher susceptibility to diseases, (d) the higher sensitivity to
            thermo & photo variations, etc., resulting in poor adaptability, and (e) longer crop duration resulting in a
            long exposure of plants to the climatic variations and insect pest / disease attacks.The Government of India
            appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility of increasing the crop productivity under
            prevailing Indian ecological conditions. As result of various steps taken by Govt. of India, the Wheat
            scenario in our country has completely changed. In the post Independence era, country used to import Wheat
            for our needs but due to bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat in the 'Green
            Revolution' period in late sixties, our country became self dependent in Wheat production. At present,
            country is producing much more excess Wheat than the requirement and Godowns are over-flooded with Wheat.

        <h1> SOIL</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and
            moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken to avoid very porous
            and excessively drained oils. Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are
            suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well. Heavy
            soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging. Wheat
            can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.
        </p>


        <h1> CLIMATIC REQUIRMENTS</h1>
        <p id="first">
            Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also
            in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the 60 degree north altitude . Wheat
            can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be
            cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool,
            moist weather during the major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the
            grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C though
            the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 c. Rains just after sowing hamper germination and
            encourage seedling blight. Areas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing.During the
            heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat. Cloudy
            weather, with high humidity and low temperatures is conducive for rust attack. Wheat plant requires about
            14-15 c optimum average temperature at the time of ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of
            grain filling and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c during this period tend to
            depress grain weight. When temperatures are high, too much energy I lost through the process of
            transpiration by the plants and the reduced residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower
            yields. Wheat is mainly a rabi (winter) season crop in India.
        </p>


        <h1>FERTILIZER MANAGEMENT</h1>
        <p id="first">
            The time and placement of fertilizer is another area where significant progress was made. It was
            demonstrated that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were required for optimum
            productivity. The N was to be applied in two split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60 kg at first
            irrigation and full phosphorus and potash to be applied as basal. Recently, the new wheat varieties have
            responded up to 180 kg N/ha with optima dose around 150 kg/ha. In the Indo-Gangetic plains, application of
            zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat system was found to increase the yield substantially. Recently, the use of
            sulphur has been found beneficial for enhancing the productivity as well as the grain protein content of
            wheat. Response to Mn (pockets in the Indo-Gangetic plains) and boron (eastern and far eastern region) has
            also been realized.
        </p>


        <h1> NUTRITUENT MANAGEMENT</h1>
        <p id="first">
            With intensive agriculture, deficiency of essential nutrients has also become wide spread. The work
            conducted under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Micronutrient in Crops and Soils, has shown
            wide spread deficiency of zinc in soils in India. At the national level, the deficiency level in micro
            nutrients is Zn: 46 %, B: 17 %, Mo: 12 %, Fe: 11 % and Cu: 5%. The deficiency of sulphur has also been
            reported across a wide range of soils (38%).The yield response to sulphur has been obtained in more than 40
            crops including cereal, millets, oilseeds and pulses etc. To realize the potential yield, strategies may
            include
            Site specific nutrient management for targeted yieldsIntegration of crop residues, bio fertilizers etc with
            inorganic fertilizationTillage techniques like FIRBS for increasing nutrient use efficienciesRemote sensing
            for efficient Nutrient managementNutrient management, straw quality vis-à-vis human and animal health
